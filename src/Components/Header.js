              QWIKFIX is a platform for both the field service providers and
              customers to interact with each other for mutual benefits. It is
              an unconventional platform where the website acts as a platform
              for service providers to sell their service at their own price
              unlike the conventional form of service providing where the
              company actually employs people to provide service.
